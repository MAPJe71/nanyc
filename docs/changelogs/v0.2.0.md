## ChangeLog v0.2.0




### Language

 * **changed**: new syntax for attributes: #[name: optional-value]. This change
   would avoid ambiguities with syntactic sugar for arrays.
 * **changed**: attributes are now accepted by all expressions and are no longer
   reserved to functions, classes and variables.

 * **added**: attribute `nodiscard`, but produces no effect yet
 * **added**: attribute `per`, but produces no effect yet



### Library

 * **added**: `pointer<:T:>`, for using weak pointers
 * **added**: std.memory, for low level memory allocations



### C-API

 * **added**: `nany_print_info_for_bugreport()`, behave like `nany_get_info_for_bugreport`
   but print it directly to `stdout`.
 * **changed**: `nyt_pointer` has been renamed to `nyt_ptr`
