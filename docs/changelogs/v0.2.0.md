## ChangeLog v0.2.0


### Language

 * **changed**: new syntax for attributes: #[name: optional-value]. This change
   would avoid ambiguities with syntactic sugar for arrays.
 * **changed**: attributes are now accepted by all expressions and are no longer
   reserved to functions, classes and variables.

### C-API

 * **changed**: `nyt_pointer` has been renamed to `nyt_ptr`
